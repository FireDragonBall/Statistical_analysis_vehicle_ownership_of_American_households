1. Create a Pareto chart of the top 10 states with the highest average number of
vehicles per household in 2016.
2. Create a relative frequency distribution histogram from the “2016 percentage of
households without vehicles” for the entire country. Comment on the shape of the
distribution.
3. Create a cumulative frequency line plot of the “2016 percentage of households
without vehicles” for the entire country.
4. Perform numerical descriptive statistics for the “2016 Vehicles per Household” for
the entire country.
5. For the “2016 percentage of households without vehicle” for the entire country,
determine whether there are any outliers. Comment on the states to which the
outliers belong.
6. Repeat tasks 2-5 above for the “2015 percentage of households without vehicle”.
Describe whether there are any similarities or dissimilarities in the distributions of
the two variables that you have analyzed (the two variables are: “2016 percentage
of households without vehicles” and “2015 percentage of households without
vehicles”).
7. Create a table that shows the average number of vehicles per household by state in
2016 (organize the table by states in alphabetic order). Next, create a same table for
2015, and create a scatter plot of the average number of vehicles per household by
state in 2016 versus that of 2015. Use the scatter plot to describe whether there
exists a correlation between the two quantities above. Interpret this correlation in
words.
